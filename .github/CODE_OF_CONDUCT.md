# Rules
1. No bullshit. This is to be used in addition to uMMORPG to develop your dream game.
2. Respect copyright. In short: do not send uMMORPG to anyone.
3. Don't send around binary files to minimize risk of viruses.

4. If you want to advertise something not related to uMMORPG, please talk to @vis2k first.
5. Do not send your order number or personal information to anyone but @vis2k.
6. Some channels are only accessible by certain groups. Do not share any information from those channels with people not in those groups.

# Help
Please use the #help channel or one of the other channels if you are looking for help and tag me with @vis2k if necessary instead of asking me in DMs. This way everyone else can see the answers too.
